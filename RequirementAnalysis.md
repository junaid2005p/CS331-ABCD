# End to End Business Automation Platform

version : 0.1.0



## 1. Purpose of the System

The purpose of this system is to design and develop a web-based Business Process Automation Platform that enables organizations to define, execute, monitor, and optimize internal workflows using a rule-driven orchestration engine.

The platform aims to eliminate manual coordination, reduce delays, increase transparency, and provide auditability across business operations.

## 2. Scope of the System

The system provides a configurable workflow engine capable of automating a wide range of business processes such as but not limited to
- Employee onboarding
- Leave approvals
- Expense reimbursement
- Procurement requests
- IT service requests
- Compliance approvals

The platform is generic and can be used by any organization to model their internal processes without writing code.
