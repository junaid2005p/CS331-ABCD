Automated Quality Inspection using Computer Vision
An image-based system that detects surface and structural defects (cracks, missing parts, deformations) in products, highlights the defective regions, and outputs pass/fail decisions to reduce manual inspection and improve consistency.

Novelty (40% weightage)

Explainable Defect Localization — highlights defect regions (bounding boxes / heatmaps) and provides a short rule-based explanation for the failure.

Confidence-Aware Escalation — assigns a confidence score; low-confidence cases are auto-flagged for manual review instead of automatic rejection.

Feedback-Driven Adaptation — stores human corrections and incrementally updates the dataset/model to improve accuracy over time.
