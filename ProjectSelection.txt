This is for Project Selection. Everyone is to add their preferred project ideas with little information.

1. Automated Quality Inspection using Computer Vision
An image-based system that detects surface and structural defects (cracks, missing parts, deformations) in products, highlights the defective regions, and outputs pass/fail decisions to reduce manual inspection and improve consistency.

Novelty (40% weightage)

Explainable Defect Localization — highlights defect regions (bounding boxes / heatmaps) and provides a short rule-based explanation for the failure.

Confidence-Aware Escalation — assigns a confidence score; low-confidence cases are auto-flagged for manual review instead of automatic rejection.

Feedback-Driven Adaptation — stores human corrections and incrementally updates the dataset/model to improve accuracy over time.


2. Intelligent Chatbot with Task Execution Automation

An intelligent chatbot that understands natural language commands and executes real tasks (like scheduling, sending emails, running scripts, triggering CI jobs) in a secure and auditable way, instead of just chatting.

Build a chatbot interface (web/CLI).
Convert user messages → intent + parameters (NLU).
Design a task planner that breaks requests into executable steps.
Implement a secure task executor with permission checks and confirmations.
Add connectors (email, calendar, file ops, shell scripts, APIs).
Maintain action history, logs, and error handling.

Novelty 

Explainable Execution Plans
Bot shows a step-by-step plan before executing and allows user edits/approval.
Composable Task Intelligence

3. End-to-End Business Process Automation Platform

Objective is to build a web-based platform that automates business workflows and internal processes using a rule-driven orchestration engine.
Each workflow is modeled as a sequence of steps with conditional routing. Users submit requests which are processed automatically based on defined rules and roles.

Novelty ideas:

Analytics engine for bottleneck detection, SLA prediction, anomaly detection, and process optimization.

Human Behavior–Aware Routing: The engine learns approval patterns of individuals like Who delays most, Who approves fastest. Then it dynamically routes tasks to optimize completion time.

Workflow Digital Twin & Simulation Engine: Before deploying a workflow, the system simulates it using historical and synthetic data to predict: Bottlenecks, Delays, SLA violations, Resource overload

AI Workflow generator from Natural language along with option for No Code drag and drop creation of Workflows.



We have selected End-to-End Business Process Automation Platform as our project.

This project focuses on building a generalized workflow automation system where business processes are not hardcoded, but are dynamically created and executed within the platform.

Admins can design workflows using a drag-and-drop builder or by providing a natural language description, after which the system generates executable workflows. Once deployed, real users log in, receive role-based tasks, complete approvals or actions, and the workflow progresses automatically according to defined rules.


Reasons for Choosing This Project

1.Real-World Applicability:
The project models how actual business workflow automation platforms work, making it practically relevant and industry-aligned.

2.Strong System Design Focus:
It involves workflow engines, task orchestration, role-based access control, and dynamic execution, demonstrating solid backend and system engineering skills.



Why this project was chosen?
Well, this project ideas seems a vast one with many possibilities and with high engineering depth. The idea itself helps automate iterative systems in business. This project seems to me to give strong software engineering exposure. Also, the fact that the platform will be modular, service oriented will make it technically feasible.
Although the overall system is large in scope, each module individually is simple. The complexity arises from integration than technical difficulty, making it suitable for an engineering problem.


Strong novelty features we might add:
1. Workflow creation using Natural Language Processing. 
(Example: User says create me an employee onboarding workflow which starts at document verification and goes on to finance and then team selection).

2. The software can determine if a particular node in the workflow is failing or creating consistent delays. In that case it can intelligently route the tasks of that workflow through other routes.
It might use AI and additional metrics to determine the best path if the original one is not working as intended.
