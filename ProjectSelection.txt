This is for Project Selection. Everyone is to add their preferred project ideas with little information.

1. Automated Quality Inspection using Computer Vision
An image-based system that detects surface and structural defects (cracks, missing parts, deformations) in products, highlights the defective regions, and outputs pass/fail decisions to reduce manual inspection and improve consistency.

Novelty (40% weightage)

Explainable Defect Localization — highlights defect regions (bounding boxes / heatmaps) and provides a short rule-based explanation for the failure.

Confidence-Aware Escalation — assigns a confidence score; low-confidence cases are auto-flagged for manual review instead of automatic rejection.

Feedback-Driven Adaptation — stores human corrections and incrementally updates the dataset/model to improve accuracy over time.


2. Intelligent Chatbot with Task Execution Automation

An intelligent chatbot that understands natural language commands and executes real tasks (like scheduling, sending emails, running scripts, triggering CI jobs) in a secure and auditable way, instead of just chatting.

Build a chatbot interface (web/CLI).
Convert user messages → intent + parameters (NLU).
Design a task planner that breaks requests into executable steps.
Implement a secure task executor with permission checks and confirmations.
Add connectors (email, calendar, file ops, shell scripts, APIs).
Maintain action history, logs, and error handling.

Novelty 

Explainable Execution Plans
Bot shows a step-by-step plan before executing and allows user edits/approval.
Composable Task Intelligence
